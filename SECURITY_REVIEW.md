# Security Review

## Overview
This document captures potential vulnerabilities observed during a manual review of the FastAPI application in this repository.
Each issue includes an impact assessment and recommended mitigation steps. The items below reflect the most pressing risks
discovered in the current codebase.

Recent changes introduced CSRF middleware plus front-end helpers that populate a `csrf_token` field automatically, which
mitigates the previously reported cross-site request forgery risk.【F:main.py†L772-L874】【F:static/js/app.js†L1-L99】
The mini-cart now renders entries with text nodes only, and table selection is handled through a POST endpoint so the
CSRF middleware protects the mutation path.【F:static/js/app.js†L683-L715】【F:main.py†L3524-L3538】

## Findings

No outstanding findings remain after addressing the high- and medium-severity issues logged in the previous review.

## Next Steps
Continue regression-testing the hardened upload pipeline and session middleware across staging and production environments.
Ensure deployment manifests explicitly set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` (or advertise an HTTPS `BASE_URL`) so the runtime picks
up the secure-cookie behaviour, and schedule periodic reviews of newly exposed endpoints before release.
