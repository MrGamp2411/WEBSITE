    <ul>
      <li><strong>Delightful guest journeys</strong> – intuitive menus, real-time order tracking, and secure payments from any device.</li>
      <li><strong>Empowered teams</strong> – dashboards that help bartenders stay on top of tickets and respond to guests faster.</li>

    <h2>Where we are headed</h2>
    <p>We continue to expand the platform with richer loyalty tools, flexible payouts, and integrations that help bars focus on hospitality, not hardware. New releases are rolled out frequently and shared in our Help Center so teams can adopt them with confidence.</p>
